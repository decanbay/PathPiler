# PathPiler
I inititally cerated this for myself as I had too many tabs open. Now I drag the url to this preset size url and only have 1 tab open. Queue works in a FIFO manner.
You can get an executable version of the program with the code below.

`
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --exclude-module _ssl --exclude-module pyqt5 PathPiler.py
`
